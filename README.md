1)
Basic Smart Contract Creation:
Problem: Develop a simple smart contract that represents a digital notary. Users can submit documents (or document hashes) to the blockchain to prove the existence of the document at a certain point in time.
Tools: Ethereum, Solidity, Remix IDE.

2)
Token Creation:
Problem: Create an ERC-20 or ERC-721 token. An ERC-20 token can be like a new cryptocurrency, while an ERC-721 can represent unique assets (like collectibles).
Tools: Ethereum, Solidity, OpenZeppelin library.

3)
Loan System with Collateral:

Problem: Develop a decentralized loan system where users can lock up tokens as collateral and borrow other tokens. If they donâ€™t repay by a certain time, the collateral can be claimed.
Tools: Ethereum, Solidity, DeFi concepts.
